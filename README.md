# RCT-summarization-data

Data from our AMIA 2020 paper "Generating (Factual?) Narrative Summaries of RCTs: Experiments with Neural Multi-Document Summarization". Pre-print: https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11293.

All data here is from abstracts indexed by and available on PubMed. The inputs are titles and abstracts of articles describing randomized controlled trials (RCTs); the targets are taken as the "Author Conclusions" subsection of Cochrane (https://www.cochranelibrary.com/) evidence syntheses of the same.  

See the Jupyter notebook for a bit more explanation.
